## Features

- **Supported Input Formats**: BLF (Binary Logging Format), ASC (ASCII format)
- **Supported Output Formats**: CSV, MAT (MATLAB format)
- **Multiple Resampling Options**:
  - 10ms period resampling
  - 100ms period resampling
  - 1 second period resampling
  - Original sampling (individual time axis for each message)
- **GUI Interface**: Easy-to-use tkinter-based graphical interface
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar during conversion
- **DBC Support**: Uses CAN database files (.dbc) for signal decoding

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- See `requirements.txt` for detailed dependencies

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CANDataConverter.git
cd CANDataConverter
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
```bash
python CANdata2matcsv.py
```

2. In the GUI:
   - Select your CAN database file (.dbc)
   - Select your CAN log file (.blf or .asc)
   - Choose your preferred time axis resampling option
   - Choose output format (CSV or MAT)
   - Click "Convert!"

3. The converted file will be saved in the same directory as your input log file with an appropriate suffix indicating the resampling method used.

## Download Pre-built Binary

## Output Format

### CSV Format
- Resampled data: Single CSV with all signals aligned to common time axis
- Original sampling: Transposed CSV with individual time axes per message

### MAT Format
- Structured MATLAB file with signal groups organized by CAN ID
- Each CAN ID group contains its signals and time axis

## Version History

- **v2.02** (2026): Added DBC/BLF integrity check and decode error handling
  - **Data Integrity Check**: Pre-conversion validation that detects data size mismatches between DBC definitions and actual BLF data
  - **Decode Error Skip**: Automatically skips messages that cannot be decoded and continues processing valid data
  - **Error Summary**: Displays detailed error report at the end of conversion, showing which message IDs had decode errors and how many
  - **User Confirmation**: Asks for user confirmation before processing when integrity issues are detected
  - **Improved User Experience**: Enhanced progress indicators and cleaner warning messages
- **v2.01** (2026): GitHub release version - Replaced CAN_Extractor.exe with CAN_Extractor.py
- **v2.00**: 64-bit version
- **v1.05en**: English message support
- **v1.05**: Performance improvements, individual time axis support
- **v1.04**: Icon settings, UI refinements
- **v1.03**: Bug fixes for certain DBC files
- **v1.02**: Support for filenames containing dots
- **v1.01**: Error message improvements
- **v1.0**: Initial release
